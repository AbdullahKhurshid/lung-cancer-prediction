# lung-cancer-prediction

## Overview
This project explores the use of Python libraries for data visualisation, machine learning, and statistical analysis in creating predictive models.

## Problem Statement
Lung cancer is as serious national comcern in Singapore and it is now the third most
common cancer across both genders. lung cancer as the number o is expected
to rise greatly over the next decade. Hence, we must investigate its causes by
analysing different factors such as age, lifestyle choices and symptoms.

The primary dataset used are from a given survey data of indiviauas with or without lung cancer.

The schema of the dataset used is as follows:

| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CustomerNo | An identification number for each unique customer |
| TransactionNo | An identification number for each unique transaction |
| Date | The date on which the transaction was made |
| ProductNo | An (alpha)numeric code for each unique product |
| ProductName | Name of Product |
| Price | Unit Price of the specific product |
| Quantity | Quantity purchased for a single product within the transaction
| Country | Country where the customer is based in

## Objectives
There are three objectives to this project:

1) Produce isnisghtful and clear data visualisations to raise public awareness of lung cancer. This visualisations would be incorporated in a written report.
2) Create a predictive model using diffferent machine learning approaches to determine the likelihood of developing lung cancer.
3) Present your findings in a coherent and clear presentation.

## Methodology

For this project, we addopted the following process:

1) Data Cleaning & Preperation
2) Exploratory Data Analysis
3) Feature Engineering
4) Machine Learning Modelling
5) Model Evaluation
6) Model Deployment
